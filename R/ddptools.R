#' ddptools: A package for processing Federal Reserve Board statistical releases
#'
#' FRB statistical releases are made available for download in SDMX format via
#' the Data Download Program (\url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/}).
#' The size and structure of these files can make them somewhat inconvenient to
#' use. This package provides functions to make these data more accessible.
